# Drover — Project State

## Decisions (AD-NNN)

Durable, cross-cycle. Architecture-level decisions live in `docs/adr/`; entries here are cycle-scoped picks that later cycles must honor. Mirrored from each cycle's `context.md`.

| ID | Decision | Source |
|---|---|---|
| AD-001 | Migrations: embedded `.sql` via `embed.FS` + minimal internal migrator, `drover_schema_version` table | cycle-a `context.md` D-1 |
| AD-002 | Full 7-state enum created in migration 001; transitions guarded in storage layer | cycle-a D-2 |
| AD-003 | Cycle A: handler error ⇒ `dead` immediately; Cycle B MUST replace this branch with retry scheduling | cycle-a D-3 — **superseded by AD-013/AD-014 and the cycle-b disposition table** |
| AD-004 | Schema is forward-compatible: `attempt`/`max_attempts(25)`/`errors`/`scheduled_at`/`leased_until`/`queue` from day one; fetch predicate already Cycle-D-shaped | cycle-a D-4 |
| AD-005 | `leased_until` written on claim but unenforced until Cycle B rescuer | cycle-a D-5 — **discharged by AD-016** |
| AD-006 | Constant 1s default poll interval; DB errors log + wait one tick | cycle-a D-6 |
| AD-007 | `Register` panics on duplicate kind; empty kind ⇒ `ErrInvalidKind` at Insert | cycle-a D-7 |
| AD-008 | Unexported `driver` interface; `internal/pgdriver` (pgx+sqlc) + `internal/memdriver` (tests only); export deferred | cycle-a D-8 |
| AD-009 | A retrying job waits in `retryable` with `scheduled_at` set; the fetch predicate widens to `available`/`retryable`/`scheduled`, with no promoter component | cycle-b `context.md` D-1 |
| AD-010 | A snoozed job waits in `scheduled`, not `retryable` — a deferral is not a failure | cycle-b D-2 |
| AD-011 | Snooze decrements `attempt` (floored at zero) so it consumes no attempt | cycle-b D-3 |
| AD-012 | Rescue never changes `attempt`: the attempt that stranded the row was really spent | cycle-b D-4 |
| AD-013 | A recovered panic is a retryable failure, with its stack trace retained | cycle-b D-5 |
| AD-014 | An unregistered job kind is a retryable failure, so rolling deploys do not destroy jobs | cycle-b D-6 |
| AD-015 | `RetryPolicy` is a one-method interface `NextRetry(job *JobRow) time.Time`, defaulting to the exponential policy; a past answer means "claimable now" | cycle-b D-7 |
| AD-016 | The rescuer re-claims expired rows with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and a fresh lease, then reuses the ordinary `running` → terminal transitions | cycle-b D-8 |
| AD-017 | Jitter uses `math/rand/v2` directly and is not injectable; tests assert the documented bound over many samples | cycle-b D-9 |
| AD-018 | The heartbeat stops only after the fetch loop returns, not at context cancellation, so a draining job never loses its lease | cycle-b D-10 |

## Roadmap progress

| Cycle | Feature | PR | Merged |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Walking skeleton | `cycle-a-walking-skeleton` | #1 | 2026-07-25 |
| B — Reliability core | `cycle-b-reliability-core` | — | in progress |

## Handoff

- **Active feature**: `cycle-b-reliability-core` — spec, context, design and tasks written; Execute pending
- **Branch**: `feat/retries-leases-and-rescue`
- **Next**: execute T1–T9 (four phases), then the mandatory fresh Verifier, then publish
- **After this cycle**: Cycle C — concurrency (per-queue worker pools, fetcher→workers channels, `Start`/`Stop` graceful shutdown). Cycle B's in-flight set, heartbeat and supervisor are built to accept N concurrent jobs unchanged.
